## Business Info

This application will process orders to move items (products) from one (or more) facilities to a destination facility.

These items must be processed at the source facility (retrieved from stock, packaged, packed into containers).

The containered items are then loaded onto transport trucks.

These trucks then transport the ordered items over approved shipping routes.

The ordered items are unloaded, unpacked and delivered to their destination facility.

This project is to develop an application that will perform these Order Processing & Logistics functions – it will automatically process customer orders – a very time-intensive process when done manually. The input of information, order processing, and results generation should all be handled by your application.

This project consists of a number of services:
  Facility
  Inventory
  Item
  Network
  Order
  Schedule
